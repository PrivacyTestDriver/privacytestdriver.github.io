A picture is worth a thousand words

It's summer.  You may want to travel, visit family or friends, or just enjoy watching a butterfly float past.  You probably want to save the memory with a picture, or share it with a picture you post online. 

You may already know that your camera/phone saves information about the picture, such as time and date, and location. You may have chosen to turn this feature off.  

What other information is in the picture? 

Anything else in the picture is in the picture.  
Other people, buildings, vehicles, your mail/ bills/ package labels, your credit card, car GPS...

Other people may be in the picture.  Not everyone wants to share where they are and what they are doing.  Maybe there is drama, or even a restraining order, in their life and they very much do NOT want it shared where they are and what they are doing.  See if you can get a good angle without other people identifiable in the background, or ask if it's OK.  If it isn't OK for them to be in your picture, please wait for them to clear the area.  You may be able to reassure them that you won't be publicly posting the picture.  Bear in mind that any posting online (including private groups) may be found by a determined investigator, and that the Internet doesn't forget.  If you do post in a private group then get agreement from EVERYONE in the group that NOTHING will be shared further, or anywhere else, or outside your private group. 

Buildings, businesses, and landmarks may be in the picture.  
You can find the location where a picture was taken by adding these background bits together.  

Geolocation skills can be useful for a geocache quest, geologists, anthropologists, marketing, building and bridge damage estimation for disaster recovery, law enforcement, journalism, war crimes investigation, offensive cybersecurity, and stalkers.

JoseMonkey can (usually) find the location where a picture was taken if you post your video or picture, tag him in the comments and say or have a sign asking him to find you, and are over 18.

Have fun, but also remember that it's not just all about you.
