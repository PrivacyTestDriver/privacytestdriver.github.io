Holiday Season is right upon us and the New Year is just around the corner. 
It is the end of the final shopping season of the year, when
many are still doing their last last minute shopping, hoping
the overworked (and often unappreciated)
delivery people from both the Post Office and the UPS/Federal
Express/DHL will deliver them in time.

This is also a time to be with (or contact) friends, reflect upon what you 
have achieved, and plan for the 2024.

With all this travelling, buying, and communicating, it is also a great
opportunity for those with coal in their hearts to use the Festive Season
to spread malware, collect personal data, and hand out data breaches.

- Expect phishing attacks to be on the rise, specially using 
[phone calls](https://phishphillet.com/blog/2023/10/20/talkie-phish.html)
and
[text messages](https://phishphillet.com/blog/2023/12/08/swiss-phish-message.html)
pretending to be a loved one in need or a misplaced package.

- The pictures you took of your holiday events and shared in social media
[may be used against you](https://privacycrashes.privacytestdriver.com/blog/2023/07/31/a-picture-is-worth.html)

- Do not 
[sacrifice privacy for convenience](https://privacycrashes.privacytestdriver.com/blog/2023/03/27/panera-palm-scanning.html)

For those of you who are business owners, this is not a time to relax your
defenses.

- The MOVEit-related data breaches, which 
[we talked about before](https://privacycrashes.privacytestdriver.com/blog/2023/09/30/moveit-breach.html),
are still going strong.

- This is also the time when

scams are on the rise. 

# What can you do?

*Vigilance is the Price of Freedom*, and that means *you* being vigilante.
Don't rely the protection of your (and that of your customers and employees) 
information on some magic product or service.
You need to understand what you need to protect and how much you need to share
before deciding on how to do that.
There are a lot of resources out there.
Companies like 
[ours](https://privacytestdriver.com/)
offer training on business/personal
data security and data privacy.
The Federal Trade Commission puts out 
[consumer alerts](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts).
We run a site discussing the different types of 
[phishing attacks](https://phishphillet.com/) we have observed and how to
identify them.  

You are not alone but you must do your part.
Make learning about data security and data privacy a goal for next year.
